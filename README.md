# HOSPITALITY-ANALYSIS-TABLEAU
# 🏨 Hospitality Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

Hi, I'm Utkarsha Pazare 👋  
This is one of my recent data analytics projects where I built an interactive dashboard in **Tableau** to analyze performance in the hospitality industry. The goal was to turn raw data into useful insights that can help drive better business decisions.

## 📊 What the Dashboard Shows

This dashboard highlights some key metrics like:

- 💰 Total Revenue
- 🛏️ Occupancy Rate
- ❌ Cancellation Rate
- 📈 Total Bookings
- 📦 Utilized Capacity

I also included breakdowns like:

- Weekday vs. Weekend Performance
- Room Class-wise Revenue
- Business vs. Luxury Trends
- State and City-wise Revenue
- Booking Platform Analysis

There are filters for users to explore data by city, room class, category, platform, and booking status.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Most bookings happen on **weekdays**, especially in the **Business** category → great for targeting corporate clients.
- **Elite and Presidential** rooms brought in the most revenue → promoting premium rooms could increase profits.
- The **'Others' booking platform** had the highest bookings → more research here could help improve channel strategy.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Tableau Public
- Excel (for initial data prep)
